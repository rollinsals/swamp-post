# Fen Friends
### A Pico-8 Game

Playable here: [itch.io](https://salsberyr.itch.io/fen-friends)

Fen Friends is my first project and an example of my early code. It is made with Pico-8, which, for the unfamiliar, is a “fantasy console” in that it is meant to simulate a retro game console that never existed. Pico-8 provides its own development environment for code, sprites, and sound. Code is written in Lua to be approachable, fast, and lightweight. One of the point of appeal for the “fantasy console” is limited scope, constraints are (arbitrarily) small. Since the maximum size of a game (cart) is 32k space is limited and the code ends up being rather clipped - missing detailed comments or documentation and often non-descriptive variable names.

For the curious, Pico-8 is available at [their website](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)

Notes on Fen Friends Retrospectively. As a game, it is obtuse, somewhat intentionally so, but perhaps to the point of incoherence. The mechanics for the water in the upper left portion of the map was not totally satisfactory and has a lot of potential to be frustrating.
